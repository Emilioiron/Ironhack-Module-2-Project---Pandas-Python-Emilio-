# Ironhack Module 2 Project: BI con Tableau

## Objetive

* This project aims to use the Tableau program to perform data analysis and graphical representations based on data.

* The work to carry out this project is individual but supervised by the regular professors and the TA assistant professors.

* To carry out the project, data from [Awesome Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) and [Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) will be searched.


## Steps I have followed

* A Tableau story has been constructed that consists of a minimum of 5 history visualizations for the chosen data, as requested for the project.
* Story features like subtitles and annotations are built
* Contents seen in the chapter such as classification, filtering, different visualizations, etc. have been worked on.
* The project has been saved in Tableau Public.
* This Github repository has been created for this particular project and the data is saved in the Data folder.
* This file has been included, README.md, which explains the steps I have followed to carry out the project.
* Finally, I have added a link to my workbook in Tableau Public.

## Technical requirements

* In order to carry out the project, the latest version of Tableau must be installed on the Windows operating system, since it does not exist for Linux operating systems.
* It can be installed by accessing the [official Tableau website](https://www.tableau.com)  to purchase a demo version or request a student license [here](https://www.tableau.com/es-es/academic/students).
* To download [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather) in [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com).


## Working with the data

* After searching the Kaggle website for different options, I have decided to do data analysis with Tableau of a renewable energy dataset.
* I have explored the data set and created visualizations and then create a story.
* First I analyzed the two datasets.csv that I had available and then I made a join by the date column which is the column common to the two datasets. I have changed the units to units in the United States so that the numerical data is recognized as a float type.
* I have identified all the dimensions of the new dataset individually and have been analyzing them to make combinations of them using graphs and tables.
* I have made different visualizations that try to relate the variation of the € MWh price according to the variation of the production in Mwh of renewable energies.
* Finally I created a story from all visualizations.
* Afterwards, I extracted the data in the data menu and published the story in Tableau Public. It can be seen in the following link.


## Conclusions

* Due to the short time it has taken to analyze the data, no clear conclusion has been reached on the variation in the price of energy based on the production / demand of renewable energy.
* The price of energy has a very high percentage of taxes on the one hand. On the other hand, energy production is auctioned daily according to demand but distribution in the electricity grid is common throughout the country. In addition, energy is exported from other countries such as France.
* For all this there is no direct relationship in the variation of the price and the variation of renewable energy production.
